My life were given by my mother and my father.

I think no one will remember what we did when we're small, like from 1 to 3 years old lol. But Im going to say again - you can choose not to read the rest.
This is just something that I chose to write with my "small" brain and a little bit of English grammar.
I don't know how to start so...

The things that I remember really really back then in China, in third person view which I don't really know why, I remember I'm in a house and I am taking a bath by a 
babysitter, and my parents were gone I don't know where, and I think my grandma was watching me..... A night I'm on my grandma's bed and playing a game in my
grandma's Iphone, it was nice... Me, myself, I'm taking a shower in my new home and (I don't really know why there's a window beside the shower, I am looking outside
the window but can't really see anything because in China we all take shower at night and it's all black with lots of trees.... A good afternoon when my mother is resting
on the sofa and I'm playing toys with my brother in a new home..... A night when we came back from restaurant, they gave a toy police car to my and my brother but, we've
destoryed those cars and made it become a "new" car.... A night we're watching a movie using our TV, when we finished that movie we all thought that was a bad movie, and
chatting with my family..... Morning, before school starts me and my friend(s) are infront of the school playing/buying things in the shop.... During school time but that
day is a holiday called - 六一儿童节 (June, First, Children's day) which we still have to go to school but we're playing games, doing stuffs that we do normally but without
classworks, homeworks, just having fun in the school and I bought a snack and eat it inside the classroom when the teacher is talking which it's not allowed but I still 
shared with my friends lol.... Reading my favorite book - 查理九世 (Charlie IX & DoDoMo) this series are (banned?) which I don't know why but we can only read the old ones
no more new ones.... A moment with me and my friends saying I'm even higher than the students that are bigger than us in grade (grade 3 higher than grade 4), yes I am a 
pretty strong, high, ugly person back then..... A time when we don't have to go to school and I am catching grasshopper and tadpole and putting them inside of plastic 
bottles which I don't know where I picked up, swing tree vines in the community that we lived..... Playing phone and eating snacks with my brother in a corner, because 
that time we're about to leave China and trip to United States..... Sitting in a bus with people that were playing with us in United, as well, me and my brother made friendship
with a 年轻小伙 (young guy) in the bus, he is the head of this trip..... Moment we eating really big hamburgers.

When we came to Canada it was 2017 and we lived in my cousin's house some where in Canada I forgot but then we moved to Ontario, Mississauga with our another cousin and
lived with them few days, then they helped us found our first HOME in Canada, Ontario, Toronto..... Moment with me and my family in the small basement watching a game which
Toronto Raptors VS (other basketball teams) using laptop..... In the church where near our home and we had lots of fun in it, it's a Chinese church, and we went to
camp with them but then one time I was playing with other kids on the beach, when I get up to the sand area they found out that my right foot has a leech sucking MY BLOOD
omg it's... :green face: yea but I am fine nothing really happened after that..... Grade 6, in the area that we lived the schools actually had a trip/camp called: Kearney
it's grade 6 only and we live there 2 nights, it was very fun we learned about some histories and some things we have to do when we are outside on the wild field with 
animals like Africa or in (Rain)forests..... Playing Minecraft and doing homeworks about what we did in Minecraft in school..... Playing Four-Squared-Basketball version
infront of our school with my friends..... Moments that all my old friends were leaving and a new student came in to our school which is my best friend right now - Kevin
Moments that playing Roblox with Kevin, and we actually went to Kearney with him too..... We moved. Leaving my best friend behind. To a new school. New friends. New people
But it did really well, I met lots people and made few friends which is Alan, Kevin Sun, and William. The first Kevin called Kevin Chen yea kc and ks lol..... We've made 
great memories back then..... But then covid hitted and we've stayed at home vitural learning for over 1 years IT WAS PAINFUL and WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARNED ANYTHING lOl.....
Like I litterily have no memories in 2020 and 2021..... 2021, September, (idk when), first day of highschool. I saw lots of students lining infront of the school.....
During Science class the teacher is teaching but I'm talking to people using the Chromebook that school gaved us for whole highschool career..... Math class... feel...
You know math class is always boring and feel sleepy but can't sleep because the teacher will know :sob:..... Finally first semester is finished, now the second semester
is a little bit different than the first one..... Moment in during December playing Mobile Legends : Bang Bang with...friends and I've met 2 girls... that... if you're
reading this you should know who are they... sigh... Anyways back to here, second sememster. Now when first semester the schedule was very different, first semester
schedule was like we have week1 and week2 week1 were learning 2 same classes same times in that week, week2 are the same but the classes changed to other two different
classes... Second semester is like normal ones, peirod 1, 2, 3, 4 all different classes and day 1's schedule is c1, c2, c3, c4 then day 2's schedule is c1, c2, c4, c3.....

Moments
talking
to
one
of
the
girls
in
Discord, called: (sike) haha not gonna put her name there, anyways that girl caught me, just don't know why like literally her skin colour isn't the same as mine but 
she, her......my English is bad can't describe how I feeeeeeeeeeel....只能说 我心动了 她的确很漂亮 不过 我也知道 这是异地恋 几乎不可能的 但是我就想试一试 想做点什么 去抓住她
我也想过毕业之后找工作存款 然后去奔现 不顾这一切都只是我的 梦想 想象 几乎不可能实现的 而且她还比我大几个月 我朋友都说我不行的。

But I don't even have a credit card right now LMAO..... I'm very super extremly so f*ing stupid I've made a confession even tho we've only met like 4 months which is
super dumb, I regetted I wish I can go back and don't do that, but yea it's my first confession in my f*ing life, I was too f*ing exited and no patience.
Now.

What I wants to do in the future. 
First, I've said it. then if she agreed then we will see but if she disgreed, I also understand her but 《Life Goes On》 right - keep working that's what basically 
every Chinese young, old people still doing right now, work work then buy car buy house marrirage then work more for the partner or kids / or both (hopefully both lol)
钱，买房，钱，婚姻，孩子，钱，婚后生活，钱，养孩子，钱，长辈，钱，供孩子上学，钱，老了，孩子长大了，又要钱。yea you can translate using translator or read mine lol,
Money, House, Money, Marrirage, Child(dren), Money, Kids grown up, Money, Grandparents, Money, Schools, Money, when you're becomes a old men, still needs money
anyways. Money is everywhere and nowhere in the world. 梦想有没有实现 (Did my dream come true) 我爸妈都说了要规划好你的未来 (my parents told me to make a good schedule
of my future) 但是有没有想过计划来不及变化，如果突然间世界大战三突然爆发 或者又一场瘟疫爆发了 这些都是可能的还是非常可能发生的。(But you can't see the future, what if WW3 happened
what if another plague bursts, these things are very likely to happen. But hopefully not)

:) alright this is a...I don't know what should I called but basically - Life.
