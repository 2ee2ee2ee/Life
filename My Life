My life were given by my mother and my father.

I think no one will remember what we did when we're small, like from 1 to 3 years old lol. But Im going to say again - you can choose not to read the rest.
This is just some random thing that I chose to write with my "small" brain and a little bit of English grammar.
I don't know how to start so...

The things that I remember really really back then in China, in third person view which I don't really know why, I remember I'm in a house and I am taking a bath by a 
babysitter, and my parents were gone I don't know where, and I think my grandma was watching me..... A night I'm on my grandma's bed and playing a game in my
grandma's Iphone, it was nice... Me, myself, I'm taking a shower in my new home and (I don't really know why there's a window beside the shower, I am looking outside
the window but can't really see anything because in China we all take shower at night and it's all black with lots of trees.... A good afternoon when my mother is resting
on the sofa and I'm playing toys with my brother in a new home..... A night when we came back from restaurant, they gave a toy police car to my and my brother but, we've
destoryed those cars and made it become a "new" car.... A night we're watching a movie using our TV, when we finished that movie we all thought that was a bad movie, and
chatting with my family..... Morning, before school starts me and my friend(s) are infront of the school playing/buying things in the shop.... During school time but that
day is a holiday called - 六一儿童节 (June, First, Children's day) which we still have to go to school but we're playing games, doing stuffs that we do normally but without
classworks, homeworks, just having fun in the school and I bought a snack and eat it inside the classroom when the teacher is talking which it's not allowed but I still 
shared with my friends lol.... Reading my favorite book - 查理九世 (Charlie IX & DoDoMo) this series are (banned?) which I don't know why but we can only read the old ones
no more new ones.... A moment with me and my friends saying I'm even higher than the students that are bigger than us in grade (grade 3 higher than grade 4), yes I am a 
pretty strong, high, ugly person back then..... A time when we don't have to go to school and I am catching grasshopper and tadpole and putting them inside of plastic 
bottles which I don't know where I picked up, swing tree vines in the community that we lived..... Playing phone and eating snacks with my brother in a corner, because 
that time we're about to leave China and trip to United States..... Sitting in a bus with people that were playing with us in United, as well, me and my brother made friendship
with a 年轻小伙 (young guy) in the bus, he is the head of this trip..... Moment we eating really big hamburgers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we came to Canada it was 2017 and we lived in my cousin's house some where in Canada I forgot but then we moved to Ontario, Mississauga with our another cousin and
lived with them few days, then they helped us found our first HOME in Canada, Ontario, Toronto..... Moment with me and my family in the small basement watching a game which
Toronto Raptors VS (other basketball teams) using laptop..... In the church where near our home and we had lots of fun in it, it's a Chinese church, and we went to
camp with them but then one time I was playing with other kids on the beach, when I get up to the sand area they found out that my right foot has a leech sucking MY BLOOD
omg it's... :green face: yea but I am fine nothing really happened after that..... Grade 6, in the area that we lived the schools actually had a trip/camp called: Kearney
it's grade 6 only and we live there 2 nights, it was very fun we learned about some histories and some things we have to do when we are outside on the wild field with 
animals like Africa or in (Rain)forests..... Playing Minecraft and doing homeworks about what we did in Minecraft in school..... Playing Four-Squared-Basketball version
infront of our school with my friends..... Moments that all my old friends were leaving and a new student came in to our school which is my best friend right now - Kevin
Moments that playing Roblox with Kevin, and we actually went to Kearney with him too..... We moved. Leaving my best friend behind. To a new school. New friends. New people
But it did really well, I met lots people and made few friends which is Alan, Kevin Sun, and William. The first Kevin called Kevin Chen yea kc and ks lol..... We've made 
great memories back then..... But then covid hitted and we've stayed at home vitural learning for over 1 years IT WAS PAINFUL and WE DIDN'T REALLY LEARNED ANYTHING lOl.....
Like I litterily have no memories in 2020 and 2021..... 2021, September, (idk when), first day of highschool. I saw lots of students lining infront of the school.....
During Science class the teacher is teaching but I'm talking to people using the Chromebook that school gaved us for whole highschool career..... Math class... feel...
You know math class is always boring and feel sleepy but can't sleep because the teacher will know :sob:..... Finally first semester is finished, now the second semester
is a little bit different than the first one..... Moment in during December playing Mobile Legends : Bang Bang with...friends and I've met 2 girls... that... if you're
reading this you should know who are they... sigh... Anyways back to here, second sememster. Now when first semester the schedule was very different, first semester
schedule was like we have week1 and week2 week1 were learning 2 same classes same times in that week, week2 are the same but the classes changed to other two different
classes... Second semester is like normal ones, peirod 1, 2, 3, 4 all different classes and day 1's schedule is c1, c2, c3, c4 then day 2's schedule is c1, c2, c4, c3.....

Moments
talking
to
one
of
the
girls
in
Discord, called: (sike) haha not gonna put her name there, anyways that girl caught me, just don't know why like literally her skin colour isn't the same as mine but 
she, her......my English is bad can't describe how I feel....只能说 我心动了 她的确很漂亮 不过 我也知道 这是异地恋 几乎不可能的 但是我就想试一试 想做点什么 去抓住她
我也想过毕业之后找工作存款 然后去奔现 不顾这一切都只是我的 梦想， 想象 几乎不可能实现的 而且她还比我大几个月 我朋友都说我不行的。

But I don't even have a credit card right now LMAO..... I'm very super extremly so f*ing stupid I've made a confession even tho we've only met like 4 months which is
super dumb, I regetted I wish I can go back and don't do that, but yea it's my first confession in my f*ing life, I was too f*ing exited and no patience.
Now.

What I wants to do in the future. 
First, I've said it. then if she agreed then we will see but if she disgreed, I also understand her but 《Life Goes On》 right - keep working that's what basically 
every Chinese young, old people still doing right now, work work then buy car buy house marrirage then work more for the partner or kids / or both (hopefully both lol)
钱，买房，钱，婚姻，孩子，钱，婚后生活，钱，养孩子，钱，长辈，钱，供孩子上学，钱，老了，孩子长大了，又要钱。yea you can translate using translator or read mine lol,
Money, House, Money, Marrirage, Child(dren), Money, Kids grown up, Money, Grandparents, Money, Schools, Money, when you're becomes a old men, still needs money
anyways. Money is everywhere and nowhere in the world. 梦想有没有实现 (Did my dream come true) 我爸妈都说了要规划好你的未来 (my parents told me to make a good schedule
of my future) 但是有没有想过计划来不及变化，如果突然间世界大战三突然爆发 或者又一场瘟疫爆发了 这些都是可能的还是可能发生的。(But you can't see the future, what if WW3 happened
what if another plague bursts, these things are likely to happen. But hopefully not)
当然这些打仗啊瘟疫啊都还是有点过了，如果以后新冠还存在，我们还需要带口罩的话那我也没办法了，我们都已经习惯了，虽然现在已经可以不用戴口罩去一些多人的地方比如- 商场、学校...
以后想干嘛，以后想做什么工作...it depents, it depents on what collage or what university I will go. 说到工作我其实到现在还没有想清楚，不够已经有个大概了，我从小嗓子就不怎么好，总是有痰，也不会高低音，所以虽然我总听歌但是我也想做一名歌手或者一名音乐家，我学过长号，Baritone（我找不到这个乐器的中文名），

:) alright this is a...I don't know what should I called but basically - My Life.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
这里是我以后想要做什么就放在这里啦 (Here is for something that I wants to do in the future, I will write those things here)

2022 Summer Break - Tryna do volunteer with my friend(s)
22年暑假跟我朋友去做义工啦

嗨嗨


给我人生定个大大大目标 - 高中毕业必须追到她 :3  (Set a most important goal in my life - I must let her to be my girlfriend :3
如果没有的话也没关系啦 都不是小孩子了应该都能理解的 只要能真的见她一面就好了 也可以聊几句啦哈哈 [泪流]  (If she's not my gf, it's alright we're not little kids now we can understand each other, but what's the best is...meet her in real life even one minute, one second, well it's better if I can talk to her...[sob]


考个好的大学，不想进厂啊啊啊 (Get in a good Collage or University, not in the factory....)
其实以前我也想过要当一个程序员，应为我学过一些Java不过后来越学越跟不上整个班，而且本来也不想学Java想学C++不过老师说先学Java啦， 从班里出来到现在已经很久了这段时间我几乎没碰过关于编程的东西。不过最近我妈问道还要不要学Java，我说我想学C++但老师也没办法。。我其实把我学Java那段时间的一丢丢笔记给记下来了在一个Java编程的软件，我也不想删但它又占很多空间吧，我就很。。。[无语]

 曾经有人问过我从1-10给我的童年打分，我给了3分。其实我童年那么差有一些是我自己的原因，就比如我从小学开始成绩就很差，作业全部都是做到凌晨当然有时候还是没做完，明天就被老师骂，出去站，站着听课等等。。。所以当你看到我有这么大的“熊猫眼”其实是我从小时候就有的了，以前几乎十二点睡然后睡个五六小时就起来得去学校了，所以睡的时间严重不够，但身体什么的还是挺好的，体育课跑步也还行吧，就总偷懒嘿嘿。。老师让我们倒着跑两圈于是我和我兄弟就倒着跑两圈，不过他倒是跑得很快但姿势那些的都不怎么样所以老师就让我先回去了让他在继续跑 [笑死]。
 
 还有一些原因是因为一从小就只有一个兄弟，我到现在还记得他的名字- 煞笔。。嗨嗨，除了那个兄弟也就几乎没有其他人跟我玩了我弟也经常跟我玩不过那是我弟。。以前要背诗，那真的是真的痛苦，每次在课堂没背好老师就当作业了，回到家还是要背给我爸妈，有时候他们都不理的。。所以我就写小抄- 诶还成功了，最近不知道怎么就是想早起，不过还真的早起了，以前想早起可是弄个闹钟都起不来嘚。不知道是不是因为她呢。。
 
 今天也没什么想说的。越来越想她了，最近迷上了一首翻唱在哔哩哔哩的《群青》周董风的。其实我想跟她语音聊天，视频聊天，不过不知道该说什么去不冷场，每次语音聊天的时候几乎都在冷场也没什么了的，也不想总是问她的户口。。如果你还在看的话，我真的挺感动的- If you still reading this-
